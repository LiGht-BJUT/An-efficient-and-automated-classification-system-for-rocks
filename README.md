# An-efficient-and-automated-classification-system-for-rocks
This file contains the major codes for the manuscript entitled "An efficient and automated classification system for rocks based on visually explainable deep learning", which was submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence for peer review. 'rock classification model' is the model architecture, 'CAM' is the code for the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) visual explanation, and 'Confusion matrix and roc' is the code for the various comparative metrics presented in the paper.The images in the 'Dateset' folder are rock samples from the test dataset.
